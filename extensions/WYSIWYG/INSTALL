== About the project ==

This extension is developed from the official FCK extension for Mediawiki:
http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:FCKeditor_%28Official%29

The FCK editor has been replaced with the new CKEditor.

In addition to the official FCK extension, the WYSIWYG extensions supports
wikitext used in Semantic Mediawiki and also contains various other improvements
for parsing wikitext.
