* Echo events now support multiple target pages.  As a result The api output of individual
 notifications within api.php?action=query&meta=notifications no longer has a 'targetpage'
 property.  This has been replaced with a 'targetpages' property which is the same as
 'targetpage' was, but now as an array.
