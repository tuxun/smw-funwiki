Feature: Content translation special page

  As a wiki editor
  I can write a translation next to the original page,
  so that I can manually create a translation without switching tabs.

  Design:
   - https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Content_translation
   - http://pauginer.github.io/prototype-translate/content-translation.html#mies-nl

  These scenarios test the basic functionality of the Special:ContentTranslation page.

  Scenario: Anonymous user cannot use Content translation.
    When I am translating the page "Bratislava" from English to Danish
    Then I see the message "You must be logged in to translate in this page."
      And I don't see the source column
      And I don't see the translation column
      And I don't see a "Publish Translation" button

  @login
  Scenario: Logged in user viewing the special page for translation.
    Given I am logged in

    # This fails because we don't have proper loading from a local server yet
    # Then I see a source column with the text "Bratislava is the capital of Slovakia and the country's largest city."
      And the source column text is not editable
      And the language code of the source column should be "en"
      And the direction of the source column is "ltr"

      And I see a translation column with an empty editing area
      And the language code of the translation column should be "da"
      And the direction of the translation column is "ltr"

      And I see a language label saying "dansk" below the translation column's title
      And I see a translation tools column
      And I see a search box in the translation tools column
      And I see a "Publish Translation" button
      And the "Publish Translation" button is disabled
      And I see the username at the top of the page

      And the translation progress bar is in 0% state
      And the text near the translation progress bar says "0% translated"
